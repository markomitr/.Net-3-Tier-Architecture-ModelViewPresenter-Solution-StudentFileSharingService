Students file sharing social network using 3 tier architecture and MVP pattern

The problem: 

Students have a problem - Unorganized and too much of a hassle to get books, materials and files for learning. They were all over the place, paper files, e-books, files on different servers etc.

Goals:

All the data/files at one place
Available anytime
Notification for new data/files
Sharing the knowledge
The solution: Student social network for file sharing.

Motto: From the students, for the students - get the right information, at the right time.

= Software solution description:
- Model-View-Presenter pattern
- Three(3) tier architecture
- Web and Desktop Application using MVP
- Database design and development
- Team Foundation Server for source control and team managment



= Model-View-Presenter pattern
- Using a separation of concerns/responsible design approach you will increase code reuse
- Separate business logic from user interface (UI) logic to make the code easier to understand and maintain
- Implementing IView interface used to loosely couple the presenter from its view
- Presenter is responsible for interacting between the view/model

= Three(3) tier architecture - Reusable and portable code
- Data Access Layer
- Business Logic Layer
- Presentation Layer

= Web and Desktop Application using MVP
- We manage to develop Web Application and Desktop App in just ONE DAY! 


* Using MVP pattern, UI is  very simple, clean and quick/flexible to design and develop.  After setting up the architecture and defining the interfaces, our team was able to split and work parallel - at the same time - on the three different layers without interruption.

Other noticeable achievements:
- Customized error/exception handling
- Customized Regular expression usage
- SOLID Principles
- Design patterns
- SQL programming - store procedures, functions ...
